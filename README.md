ABSTRACT:

    Road safety is a critical concern, particularly on curved roads where visibility is limited, increasing the risk of accidents. To address this issue, we propose
    an Intelligent Curve Road Safety System. This system integrates ultrasonic sensors, a microcontroller (Arduino), LED indicators, a buzzer, an LCD display, and a 
    power supply to enhance driver awareness and safety.

    The system detects approaching vehicles using ultrasonic sensors strategically placed along the curved road. The sensor data is processed by the Arduino 
    microcontroller, which determines the presence of vehicles and triggers appropriate alerts based on predefined thresholds. Visual alerts are provided through 
    LED indicators, while auditory alerts are generated using a buzzer. Additionally, real-time information about approaching vehicles is displayed on an LCD display 
    for drivers' convenience.
    
    This abstract presents a comprehensive overview of the proposed Intelligent Curve Road Safety System, highlighting its components and functionalities aimed at 
    improving road safety on curved roads.
